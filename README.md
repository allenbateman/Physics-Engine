# Collision Engine
This is  a first attempt to create a physics engine in c++!

## Intro
This project is a small game where you have to survive destroying incoming asteroids to your position.
There are 5 plantes where gravity force will make it harder for you to know they trajectory! Defend yourself!
Also works as a particle collision simulator.

# Controls

## Player Movement
AWSD to move.

Left click to shoot.

1,2,3 to siwtch between weapons.

5,6 swap player movement type; 5->velocity, 6->forces.

##  Weapons
1 Blaster: Shoots a laser bullet that is not afected by gravity, destroyed on impact.

2 Cannon: Shoots heavy bombs, the bomb explodes when it stops. vxy = 0;

3 Bouncer: Shoots medium weight bullet, this bullet will bounce 3 time agains any wall, and then explode. Destroyed on impact with enemy.

## Game Loop Controls
G: God mode.

R: Restart game.

P: Stop/Start game.

## Other Controls
I: activate particle system, recomended to see with debug mode.

F1: Normal gravity, downwards.

F2: Satelite gravity, there is a big mass orbiting the screen, its a sun? its a starship? we dont know.

F5: Interplanetary gravity, it activates the gravity fields of the planets.
   
   Â¡There is feed back on what is the current active gravities on top left corner, F1->yellow,F2->green,F3->blue.!

F4: Debug mode.

F5: Switch between 30/60 fps.
